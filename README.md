# Human-Action-Recognition üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Recognition of human activity is important in human-to-human interaction and interpersonal relationships. It is tough to extract important features in images and videos since it contains information about a person's identity, personality, and psychological condition.
One of the key or major objectives of research in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to identify another person's activity.
Many applications, such as video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robots for human behavior characterization, now require a multiple activity detection system
therefore leading to numerous technological research in this field.

## ABOUT ‚úàÔ∏è

This project took into consideration of 11 classifications which are:
- Breakdancing
- Calligraphy
- Celebrating 
- Claypotterymaking
- Climbingarope
- Cookingoncampfire
- Eatingicecream
- Golfdriving
- Pushup
- Raisingeyebrows
- Ridingscooter
This simply means the model has eye only on eleven subjects. if the model is exposed to any activities other than the one stated above the model is designed to return None.

## DEPLOYMENT üçé

The project was deployed using an android studio. where the designed model was uploaded in other to predict the human actions either by uploading an image/video or real time video detection.
